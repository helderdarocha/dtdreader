xURG - XML User Reference Generator
by Helder da Rocha (hlsr@uol.com.br)
Version 0.1 Alpha

This program generates a skeleton for a user's reference guide for any XML-compatible language. This is done by reading the language's DTD and generating a collection of XML files representing individual elements and attributes. Each file has fields which may be filled in by the author by typing the text directly or via macro substitution. Once the files are generates the author can, at any moment, release an HTML or printable (PDF) version of the reference manual.
If any new elements or attributes are added to the language, the author can update his or her files with the skeletons for the new features. This version does not allow removal of attributes or elements from the source documents.
To control the layout of the final version of the reference, the author can use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for the HTML version or edit the XSL templates for the PDF and HTML versions. There is no simpler way, at this moment, to control output layout.
